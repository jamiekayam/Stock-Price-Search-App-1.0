React.js Project: Stock Price Search App Ver 1.0
Designed and Developed by Jamie Kayam - March 2024
This is Jamie Kayam's first React.js project, a simple search engine that takes a stock symbol as an input, concatenates the text into a string that is then passed to a data fetch function to query the FinnHub API to return the latest price of the queried stock.
